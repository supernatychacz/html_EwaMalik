      <h3>Moving to the UK</h3>
      <p>
        Moving to the UK was a challenge itself,
        <br />
        in 2015 I didn't know the language,
        <br />
        because I've been learning French all my life
        <br />
        and as a person who has two professions,
        <br />
        I didn't expect that I would ever have to leave my country
        <br />
        and a foreign language might be necessary for me.
        <br />
        Finding a job, getting to know the culture, customs
        <br />
        and learning the language took me some time.
        <br />
        I still try to work on improving the quality of the language
        <br />
        whenever I get a chance.
        <br />
        All this time I am constantly learning the language
        <br />
        and other useful skills, and the constant search for knowledge
        <br />
        led me to CODE Lancashire.
